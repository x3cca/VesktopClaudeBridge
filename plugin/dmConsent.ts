 * The DM gate: asks before a private conversation leaves the renderer.
 *
 * This is the strongest of the three DM guards in this project, and the reason
 * is where it sits rather than what it checks. The sidecar's `denyDms` and
 * `allowDms` refuse content that has already crossed the process boundary; this
 * refuses before the handler runs, so nothing was ever read, serialised, or put
 * on a socket. Same argument the third eye makes for keeping its buffer in the
 * renderer — see the header of live.ts.
 *
 * It hangs off a single point. bridge.ts dispatches every RPC through one
 * `handlers[method]` lookup, so one `await` in front of that covers the whole
 * surface. That matters more than the lines it saves: the sidecar's own guard is
 * called from fifteen places, and twice now it has been found sitting downstream
 * of one of two exits (`/marked`, `/live`). A gate with one call site cannot
 * develop that bug.
 *
 * What each method can touch is a table rather than a run of ifs, and it is
 * typed `Record<RpcMethod, ...>` on purpose: adding a method to the protocol
 * without deciding whether it can reach a DM is then a compile error rather than
 * a silent hole. Same trick `handlers` itself uses.

 * How long the bridge holds an RPC open waiting for you to click.

 * A modal that waits on a human outlasts that easily, and the tool then reports
 * `timeout` — which reads as "the bridge is broken" rather than "you have not
 * clicked yet", and sends people debugging instead of answering.
 *
 * So the wait is bounded here instead, and expiry is not a denial: the modal
 * stays on screen, the refusal says so, and clicking Allow afterwards works
 * normally. At-the-keyboard is one click; away-from-it degrades to
 * approve-then-retry rather than to a misleading timeout.
 *
 * Lower `rpcTimeoutMs` below this and the sidecar gives up first, which is the
 * timeout this exists to avoid. The README says so next to the setting.

 *
 *  - `ping` carries the signed-in account and no channel at all.
 *  - `guilds`, `channels` and `scheduledEvents` are guild-scoped, which by
 *    construction holds no private channels — that gap is why `dms` exists.
 *  - `marked.clear` destroys and discloses nothing; it returns a count. Gating
 *    it would make a DM mark permanently unclearable under `off`, which is the
 *    same dead end the sidecar already refuses to build, for the same reason.
 *  - `third_eye.state` names the watched channel and carries no message bodies.
 *    It is left open deliberately, and it is the one place a DM's *identity* is
 *    visible without a prompt. Two reasons. You cannot arm a DM watch without
 *    turning on `thirdEyeWatchDms`, which is off by default, so that particular
 *    channel has already been opted into twice. And the sidecar calls `state`
 *    precisely so it can guard *before* draining — refusing the probe would
 *    break the ordering that stops a refused drain destroying the buffer it was
 *    refusing to show. The drain is gated below, which is where content lives.
